# 📓 Notes Project

Create the following file structure in a new folder `notes` inside the root folder of this codespace.
(using `mkdir`,
`touch` and `cd`):

```
notes
├── released
│   └── public
│   │   └── trash.txt
│   ├── announcement1.txt
│   └── announcement2.txt
└── unreleased
    ├── announcement3.txt
    └── private
        ├── notes1.txt
        └── notes2.txt
```

Update the structure to the following (using `mv`, `rm` and `cd`):

```
notes
├── private
│   ├── notes1.txt
│   └── notes2.txt
└── public
    ├── released
    │   ├── announcement1.txt
    │   └── announcement2.txt
    └── unreleased
        └── announcement3.txt
```

> 💡 You can use the `tree` command to see the file structure in the terminal.
